<blockquote><p>In statistical signal processing, statistics and physics, the spectrum of a time-series or signal is a positive real function of a frquency variable associated with a stationary stochastic process, or a deterministic function of time, which has dimensions of power per hertz (W Hz^-1).</p></blockquote>
