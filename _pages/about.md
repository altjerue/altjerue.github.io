## Some words about myself and this webpage

I am a mexican astrophysicist who loves programming. For a broader description on this please refer to [my CV](/cv/).

Beyond science and computers I love hiking and climbing. In other words: I love the mountains, and whenever I have the chance I go there. If not, the best approximation to that is walking down the street and going to the climbing gym.

I also like watching movies an series. I do not know if a series has a very good production or not, but I like to analyze them from a sociological and scientific point of view. I know that movies are movies. I know what fiction means, but I have found it as a very good excercise to reinforce skepticism.

<!-- ## In the mortar for sauces

*In the mortar for souces* used to be the name of a [project of blog](/mortar/) that I started long ago. It is tradition in mexican families to prepare (hot) sauces with a mortar and pestle made of volcanic stone. It is a tough task smashing all the ingredients, to estimate the correct amount of them in order to get a tasty hot sauce, yet the experience of preparing the sauce in a mortar is at the same time relaxing since you have to exert pressure on it. Ergo everything that happened to you during the day will affect the final result. That is why it is said that if the lady that prepared the sauce (women used to be the ones that had to prepare the sauce) was angry, the hotness of it was extreme. So it is recommended not to make angry to the "sauce-erer" until the sauce is on the table.

It is also true that it would be easier to prepare sauces with the blender. However the taste of anything you eat depends on the way you prepare it. That happens to bread, for instance, and so it happens to sauce. And not only the taste changes from a blender sauce but the consistency. From a blender you get a watery substance, while in a mortar-made sauce you may find small pieces of the ingredients like tomato, chilly, coriander, etc. Not to mention the control in the quantity of the ingredients, which is such a subjective topic that depends on the person who is preparing the sauce.

And just like sauce are the things that one deals with day by day. What you learn during your every day life are the ingredients, your spirit is the chilly. It is yourself who decides what the out coming sauce will look like, if you share it or use it for yourself, if it will be sweet, hot or hotter.

This blog is more or less the result of the "sauce" that gives taste to my everyday learning. Mostly all the things that I like most which are physics, astrophysics and maths. Hope it will be helpful to someone sometime.
