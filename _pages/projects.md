# Projects

### [Wind and Spores](https://github.com/UW-ForestMycobiomeLab/WindSporesHills)  | Aug 2024 -- Present

- Open Source Code for Dispersion of Spores in Hilly Terrains
- Simulate the dispersion of spores in hilly terrains in R and C++.

### [Tleco](https://github.com/zkdavis/Tleco)  | Jan 2024 -- Sep 2024

- Open Source Code for Simulation of Relativistic Particles Radiation
- *Tleco* stands for both *in the fire* and *rise* in the nahuatl language.
- Numerical code that simulates particles in relativistic plasma, and the rise of radiation from accelerating particles.
- Consists of both Rust functions and Python functions previously built in the Fortran code *Paramo*.

### [Paramo](https://github.com/altjerue/paramo)  | Oct 2018 -- Apr 2022

- Open Source Code for Radiative Transfer Simulations in Relativistic Astrophysics
- Independently developed this code for distributed settings to perform HPC simulations of radiative transfer in relativistic astrophysics.
- Optimized the code with OpenMP to reduce simulation time from 2 minutes to 5 seconds.
- Researched and applied mathematical concepts of machine learning (gradient descent) to adjust the parameters of the code to classify observations from NASA telescopes.
- This code has been used for at least 5 scientific publications and also for graduate pedagogical purposes.
- Developed data analysis and data visualization tools in Python.
